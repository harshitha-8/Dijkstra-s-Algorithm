# Dijkstra's Algorithm Implementation

## Overview
This project contains a Python implementation of **Dijkstra's Algorithm**, which is a famous algorithm used to find the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph.

## Features
- Calculates the shortest distance from a source node to all other nodes.
- Handles graphs represented as adjacency lists or matrices.
- Efficiently finds shortest paths in graphs with non-negative edge weights.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harshitha-8/Dijkstra-s-Algorithm.git
